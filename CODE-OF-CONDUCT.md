**Welcome to our open source code**
Skills-Lab-6 is a space for collaboration and the free flow of ideas, driving creativity and making coding fun! Our code is a space for programmers to collaborate with one another. In a simple .ipynb file, users can add in madlibs lines, creating unique stories from user to user.

With this said, it is understood that this is a space for diversity and inclusion of all people's ideas and beliefs regardless of one's identity. One person's idea(s) might challenge your own ideas, agree with your ideas, or cause you to think differently about a topic. Take advantage of this and allow yourself to be creative. 

As a collaborator of our code, you are agreeing to these values and setting the precedent for the next collaborators. So, we ask that you please be respectful, be creative, and contribute to an expanding story that can be unique to any user!

1. **Acceptable Behavior**
    ..1. Creativity: Allow yourself to add on to ideas, challenge ideas respectfully, and or think outside the box
    ..2. Respect: Others ideas are their own and are to be respected. This is not negotiable in this coding environment.
    ..3. Be welcoming: You additions to this code should encourage new ideas, they should not stop the flow of creativity.
    
2. **Response to Bad Behavior**
In the case that you see any code that is disrespectful or harmful to others identities or beliefs, please do not hesistate to take action. In this case please contact cag301@pitt.edu should any conflicts arise in the code from previous collaborators. The admin does not handle bad behavior lightly and will take the necessary steps to return the space to its original values.
