Skills Lab 6: Version Control

Christine Glascott, Jack Brooks, Luke Cusato

This code takes user input asking for the users name. It then asks for input asking the users favorite food. 

It then takes the input and if the users input is = pizza, the program expresses a shared likeness with pizza. If not, the program shares that it likes a different food than the user. This program is dynamic as it accepts any string input.
